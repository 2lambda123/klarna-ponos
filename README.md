## Description

Ponos is an Erlang application that exposes a flexible load generator
API. Ponos [[1](#ref1)] is named after the Greek god of hard labor and
toil
([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponos)).

## Introduction

Ponos is a simple yet powerful erlang application used to generate load
at configurable frequencies. It's designed to be lightweight, straight
forward to use and to require minimal configuration.

## Load Generators

There are only three required parts of a load generator:

* `Name`
    * A unique identifier (of type `atom()`) used to reference the load
      generator.
* `Task`
    * A callback function of arity 0; the work to be performed in
      accordance with `LoadSpec`.
* `LoadSpec`
    * The load specification defines the characteristic of the load. It
      is a function that maps time to intensity: `fun(T) -> I` where `T`
      is passed time in milliseconds and `I` is the intensity expressed
      as calls per second. The user may define its own specification,
      but ponos provides typical load patterns such as constant load,
      bursts, staircase, and sawtooth. See
      [`ponos_load_specs`](#ponos_load_specs) for a full list of load
      specifications.

### Adding and Starting Load Generators

    1> Name = foo.
    2> Task = fun() -> do_your_thing end.
    3> LoadSpec = ponos_load_specs:make_sawtooth(10, 20.0).
    4> Options = [{duration, 60*1000}, {auto_init, false}].
    5> Args = [{name,Name},{task,Task},{load_spec,LoadSpec},{options,Options}].
    6> [ok] = ponos:add_load_generators([Args]).
    7> ponos:init_load_generators([Name]).

`ponos:add_load_generators/1` takes a list of proplists where each
proplist denotes the arguments needed to add a new load generator to
ponos. The `options` argument is optional, and may contain all or none
of the available options.

Options:

* `auto_init` - Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the load
  generator will start generating load immediately. Otherwise
  `ponos:init_load_generators/0|1` have to be called to start generating
  load.
* `duration` - Defaults to `infinity`. By default the load generator
  will run until removed or paused. If set to a `pos_integer`, the load
  generator will generate load for that many milliseconds.
* `max_concurrent` - An `integer()` used to limit how many concurrently
  ongoing tasks the load generator may spawn. Note that this potentially
  affects the intensity in a negative way, i.e. you may get a lower
  output than the `load_spec` describes. By default, the load generator
  may have an infinite amount of concurrently ongoing tasks.
* `task_runner` - Defaults to `ponos_default_task_runner`. Must be a
  `module()` implementing the `ponos_task_runner_callbacks` behaviour.
* `task_runner_args` - Defaults to `[]`. May be of type any(). The value
  is passed to the `task_runner`'s `init` function.

For convenience, all operations on load generators permits referring to
a single load generator or a list of generators.

## <a name="ponos_load_specs"></a> ponos_load_specs

This module provides a set of predefined constructors for typical load
patterns. A load specification defines the characteristics of load and
is implemented as a function that maps time to intensity: `fun(T) -> I`
where `T` is passed time in milliseconds and `I` is the intensity
expressed as calls per second. The user may implement its own load
specifications.


### A Note About Sampling Intervals and Timers

A load generator is implemented as a gen_server receiving a tick every
millisecond. The `LoadSpec` - which is a function of time - thus gets
sampled at every tick to determine whether load should be sent or
not. At each tick the load generator may decide to generate multiple
calls, so it is - at least in theory - possible to produce arbitrary
large amount of cps.

In practice however the load generator itself will become CPU limited
above a point that depends on your CPU and/or OS. It is better to use
two - or more - generators to leverage the power of multi-core CPUs if
such high load is required.

There are other factors that may prevent a load generator to exactly
reproduce the specified load pattern.

One of the factors is how timers are implemented in the Erlang VM: a
timer may never fire early, but may get delayed indefinitely. This
means when the load generator decides to sleep for 1 ms, it will
usually end up sleeping for somewhat longer. This will reduce the
actual sampling frequency of the `LoadSpec`. Even if the system is not
otherwise overloaded you may not assume sampling frequencies above 500
Hz in practice.

The other limiting factor is that the load generator will favor higher
intensities over lower ones when the `LoadSpec` is not constant. This
effect is best explained via an example.

Consider a `LoadSpec` that for even seconds specifies intensity 0.5
and for odd seconds 4.0. This means ponos will try to trigger tasks at
1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, and 3000 milliseconds. The actual intensity
will be therefore 4.0 for odd seconds, but for even seconds it will
only fall to 0.8, not to 0.5. The low intensity interval is simply too
short.

## Task Runners

In essence, `ponos` gathers load generators under a supervisor and
makes sure they get a chance to execute their task at the requested
interval. Instead of executing the task itself, ponos hands over to a
task runner at certain points, e.g. when it is time to trigger a
task. For convenience, `ponos` provides two implementations of the
`ponos_task_runner_callbacks` interface:

* ponos_default_task_runner - takes no extra arguments and simply
  applies the provided `Task`.
* ponos_file_task_runner - applies the provided `Task` as well as logs
  the various events to file.

The `ponos_task_runner_callbacks` behaviour defines the following interface:

| ponos_task_runner_callbacks behaviour        |
| -------------------------------------------- |
| `call(Name, Task, State) -> ok`              |
| `concurrency_limit(Name, State::any()) -> ok`|
| `init(Name, Args) -> {ok, State::any()}`     |
| `pause(Name, State) -> ok`                   |
| `start(Name, State) -> {ok, NewState::any()` |
| `terminate(Name, State) -> ok`               |

The API allows for modifying the state of the task runner at two
occasions: `init` and `start`. In all other instances, the task runner
may view the state but has no possibility to modify it.

Please refer to `ponos_default_task_runner.erl` and
`ponos_file_task_runner.` for further reference.

## Notes

<a name="ref1"></a>[1] The author is aware of the Russian meaning of the
word *ponos*. I leave it to the Russian to fight this down with the
Greek. Needless to say, a suitable name is a suitable name.
